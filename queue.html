  <h1>Queue Builder</h1>

  <p>The devs at Poplar Puzzles would like you to treat an array of functions like a Queue, passing the result of each function into the next until the Queue is empty. They’ve sent you the puzzlers Queue of functions, and the following instructions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Build a function and assign it to a variable named applyAndEmpty.</li>
      <li>The function should take in an input number and a queue of functions as parameters.</li>
      <li>Using a for loop, call the functions in the queue in order with the input number, where the results of each function becomes the next function’s input.</li>
      <li>Once done this loop, return from applyAndEmpty the final function’s result. Additionally, the queue should be empty at this point.</li>
      <li>Lastly, call the applyAndEmpty function using the provided start variable and the puzzlers Queue as arguments, and alert the result.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

<script>

var puzzlers = [
  function(a) { return 8 * a - 10; },
  function(a) { return (a - 3) * (a - 3) * (a - 3); },
  function(a) { return a * a + 4; },
  function(a) { return a % 5; }
];

var start = 2;

// build applyAndEmpty function expression here
var applyAndEmpty=function(input,queue){
  for(var i=0,max=queue.length;i<max;i++){//max is required here
    input=queue.shift()(input);
    //immediately invoke "queue" using () with "input" as an argument
  }
  return input;
};

alert(applyAndEmpty(start,puzzlers));

//I got all the syntax correct, did not get the logics in the for loop and function, though. TOUGH ONE!

  <h1>Immediateli-Invoked Puzzler</h1>

  <p>Now the Poplar Puzzle-makers have sent you a puzzle with a new set of functions to use on that puzzle. To display your overwhelming array and function expression mastery, alert the answer to the following question:</p>

    <quote>“What is obtained when the result of passing 9 into the fourth function of the puzzlers array is then passed into the function whose array index matches the result of passing 3 into the second function of the puzzlers array?”</quote>

  <p>To really impress them, the expression used in your alert should:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Use just one line of code.</li>
      <li>Involve no manual calculation or hard-coded math on your part.</li>
      <li>Use indices of arrays to access functions.</li>
      <li>Use parentheses to pass in parameters to immediately-invoking functions.</li>
    </ol>

  <h4>Note:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>The required answer is not an example of good style, nor is it intended as such.</li>

    <li>The main point is to give you practice with the mechanics of arrays and function calls.</li>

<script>

var puzzlers = [
  function(a) { return 8 * a - 10; },
  function(a) { return (a - 3) * (a - 3) * (a - 3); },
  function(a) { return a * a + 4; },
  function(a) { return a % 5; }
];

alert(puzzlers[puzzlers[1](3)](puzzlers[3](9)));

//Your outermost call to puzzlers should have another call to puzzlers IN the index brackets, as well a third call to puzzlers in the returned function's parameter parentheses.

//If you try to put parameters in an array index, it will get resolved as a multiplication expression. Yikes!
